# Haemonc requests

Repository for code related to small tasks / validation work for supporting myeloid service


|  Ticket   |   Summary   |
|   ---     |     ---     |
| [EBH-825] | 1) Generates interactive plots of VAF distribution for all variants from a given set of VCFs
|   |   2) Merges all annotated tsvs into a large tsv file to be able to filter for a variant
| [EBH-866]  |  Validation of new capture panel, notebook generates plots with comparison of exon level coverage stats from Athena output
| [EBH-895]  | Validation of new capture panel, generate exons and bed files by querying CellBase API via URL
| [EBH-929]  | Generate a single combined anonymised tsv file from [tsvs of variants](https://github.com/eastgenomics/eggd_vcf_handler_for_uranus/blob/574cf952b735bcb21bb7a65fa81f31bd77ae06cd/dxapp.json#L327) output from handler app
| [EBH-2402]  | Count average numbers of pre-filtering variants which intersect with the MYE capture bed
| [EBH-2585]  | Identifying germline variants from somatic (haemonc) data
| [URA-97]  | Generate bed, exons and probe file for all HaemOnc transcripts by querying CellBase API via URL
